# CLEANIFY

Our Project is used for the garbage collector and garbage disposer to sort the waste which helps to manage the waste all over the world. This project is an initiative to make change and make aware of the waste disposal in a proper manner so the waste can be changed as treasure in future.

To begin with, in our project we are going to make a mobile application where the garbage disposer clicks or uploads the image of the waste which they are going to dispose and after confirmation of the images by the user, our deep learning model would be classifying the waste into the categories which is informed to the user and also the collector would be updated with the list of wastes in a categorial order which make less time to manage the waste and by this way the sorting of the wastes would be enhanced and the analytics also displayed in a proper manner with respect to the categories of overall and today. As far now we are going to create mobile application but for the future scope we would be using the live camera interaction disposal system in the Garbage bins with the deep learning model which makes the worldâ€™s waste management system to work efficiently.
